Steps to rebase your forked repository with original repository
Add the remote and call it upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mukulgoyal793/HelloWorld.git

Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches
git fetch upstream

Make sure that you're on your master branch
git checkout master

Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that other branch
git rebase upstream/master

Finally push your changes to master branch
git push origin master
